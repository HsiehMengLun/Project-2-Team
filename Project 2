##Project 2
## We aimed to study the relationship between urbanization rate, per capita GNP, and average life expectancy. 
##The conclusion is that many factors affect per capita life expectancy, and more people live longer when the GNP and urbanization are higher, but the result isn't positively correlated.
##The urbanization rate can be calculated indirectly from the total population of all cities in the country and the total population.
