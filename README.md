We aimed to study the relationship between urbanization rate, per capita GNP, and average life expectancy. The conclusion is that many factors affect per capita life expectancy, and more people live longer when the GNP and urbanization are higher, but the result isn't positively correlated.
The urbanization rate can be calculated indirectly from the total population of all cities in the country and the total population.
